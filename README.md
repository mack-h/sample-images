# sample-images
Sample z-stacks and images for testing analytical pipelines. Cortical neurons.

Looking for assistance or resources to help with wrangling ImageJ or other software for 3d cell segmentation and morphological analysis.

Please feel free to use these images to test your own pipelines, and let me know if you would like more.

Thank you!
